# Setting up Vivado on Linux

Start by downloading the lastest Linux version of Vivado from [Xilinx's website](http://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html). The current version at the time of writing this is Vivado 2016.1. Currently, Xilinx provides web installers, so the initial download is fairly small.

Once downloaded the file must be made executable. To do this run the following commands in terminal.

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
chmod +x Xilinx_Vivado_SDK_2016.1_0409_1_Lin64.bin
```
